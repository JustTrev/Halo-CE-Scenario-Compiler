# Halo-CE-Scenario-Compiler
A GUI wrapper for the Tool.exe commandline interface for Halo CE Mods.


Halo CE Scenario Compiler is a lightweight GUI API for 'Tool.exe' that allows you to easily convert any Scenario Level into a playable '.map' without using tacky command lines.

There is really nothing much other than this convert's scenario map files into playable map files using buttons instead of command lines.
